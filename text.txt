Socialise and share memories with other gamers

Make friends with other players, playing the game you're both passionate about. 
Post your latest achievements and share them with your newly acquired friends. 
Upload images of the latest event you attended and the picture you took with the icon of the community. 
Or even upload clips of your latest outplay to brag to your friends.

Find new teammates

Form a team with other players and search for new potential teammates using our filters to ensure
you're finding players in the same region, speaking the same language and aspiring to achieve the same goal, 
be it climbing the ranked ladder, entering tournaments or just playing casually.

##Send out signals

For those of you, who don't know where to start in finding new members of your team
or struggling to find a team to join, just send out a signal to other members listing 
your requirements and let them approach you.

##Form a team

Create your own new team and maybe you can be the next breakout team to snatch the prize 
pool of the next tournament. Use our in-built timetable to set routine team practices or 
even just a time to get together and simply enjoy the game.

Join communities

Form or join a community that shares something in common with you, whether that is simply 
gamers in a nearby location, or you all share the passion for a custom game. 
Make announcements in the community page to organise your next meetup or the next custom game tournament.
